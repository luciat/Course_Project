CourseProject
=============

Repository for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set, generating a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

The data used represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description of this data is available at:

The script run_analysis.R does the work described below:

  - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
  
  - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
  
  - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
  
  - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names;
  
  - Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
