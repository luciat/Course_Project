CourseProject
=============

Repository for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set, generating a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

The data used represent data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope embedded in the smartphones used by the volunteers of the experiments while performing daily activities (walking, walking_downstairs, walking_upstairs, sitting, standing and laying).

A full description of this data is available at:

More information is also avaiable in the provided Code Book.

The script run_analysis.R does the work described below:

  - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
  
  - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
  
  - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
  
  - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names;
  
  - Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
